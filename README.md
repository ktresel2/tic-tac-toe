Description:
This application is a Tic Tac Toe game that requires the user to log in to play. Once signed in, the user will begin playing as X and then rotate back and forth between X and O. The game will stop when a win has been achieved and will register a tie if the game finishes with neither X or O achieving any win condition. The user may change their password and log out while signed in.
